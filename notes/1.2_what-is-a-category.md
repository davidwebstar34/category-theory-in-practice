# Lecture 1.2: What Is a Category?

## Key Ideas:
- A category consists of:
  - Objects (dots)
  - Morphisms (arrows)
  - Composition rule
  - Identity morphism per object

## Axioms:
1. Associativity: `(h ∘ g) ∘ f = h ∘ (g ∘ f)`
2. Identity: `id_B ∘ f = f = f ∘ id_A`

## Example: Category of Sets
- Objects: Sets
- Morphisms: Functions between sets

> CT allows us to reason **only using morphisms** — we forget internal structure.
> This is the ultimate data hiding: abstraction through arrows.
