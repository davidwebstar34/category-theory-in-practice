# üß† Category Theory Meets Quantum Intuition

> Bridging abstract structure and quantum behavior through morphisms, composition, and diagrams.

## üéØ Why This Exists
After beginning a deep-dive into category theory, I wanted to anchor some of these abstract concepts in my existing understanding of quantum computing. This is a personal exploration to see how categories, morphisms, and diagrammatic reasoning can help structure intuition around quantum gates, circuits, and computation.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Intuition Sketch

Quantum circuits are naturally **compositional**: we build them by chaining smaller operations (morphisms) into larger structures. The ZX-calculus abstracts this further‚Äîallowing us to **ignore the specific gates** and instead **manipulate the logic of information flow** directly.

In this view:
- **A ZX-diagram is a morphism.**
- **Rewriting a circuit = applying categorical equivalences.**
- The rules preserve *behavior* while changing *form*‚Äîjust like category theory respects identity and composition.

## üîÑ Where This is Going

As I work through more ZX-calculus examples (via PyZX), I‚Äôll update this page to show concrete diagrammatic transformations and how they relate to category-theoretic structure‚Äîespecially around rewrite rules and completeness.

*‚ÄúCategory theory doesn‚Äôt explain what quantum computing is‚Äîit gives you a language to think about how it fits together.‚Äù*
