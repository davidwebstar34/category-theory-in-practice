# Lecture 1.1: Why Category Theory for Programmers?

- 🚀 CT is the next step in abstraction: beyond FP, OOP, even Haskell.
- 🧠 Core tools: Abstraction, Composition, Identity
- ⚠️ OOP hides the wrong things: mutation & sharing → data races
- 🧬 Functional languages (like Haskell) avoid hidden state, enabling composability
- 🧗‍♂️ CT offers a meta-language for abstraction

## Philosophy:
- We see the world as **composable** because our brains evolved to solve problems by decomposition
- CT reflects not what **is**, but how we **think** — it’s more epistemology than ontology
