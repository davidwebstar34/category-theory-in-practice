# Lecture 2.1: Functions and Epimorphisms

## Pure Functions
- Pure function = deterministic + no side effects
- Memoization test: if a function can be turned into a lookup table, it’s pure
- Must also be **total**: defined for all values in its domain

## Functions as Morphisms
- In the `Set` category: objects = sets, morphisms = total pure functions
- A function is a **special relation**: a subset of the cartesian product with specific properties

## Function Structure
- `f: A → B`
- **Domain** = A
- **Codomain** = B
- **Image** ⊆ Codomain (subset of B that f maps to)

## Isomorphisms
- A function `f: A → B` has an inverse `g: B → A` if:
  - `g ∘ f = id_A`
  - `f ∘ g = id_B`
- Then `f` is an **isomorphism**
- Defined purely in categorical terms (composition and identity)

## Two Ways a Function Can Fail to Be Invertible
1. **Collapsing**: distinct elements in domain map to the same in codomain (→ abstraction)
2. **Not covering codomain**: image ≠ codomain (→ modeling/partial structure)

## Named Properties
- **Injective (monic)**: no collapsing (preserves distinctness)
- **Surjective (epic)**: image = codomain
- **Bijective** = injective + surjective → isomorphism

## Epimorphisms in Category Theory
- Definition (purely in morphism terms):

```text
f: A → B is epic if:
  ∀ C ∀ g₁, g₂: B → C,
    if g₁ ∘ f = g₂ ∘ f,
    then g₁ = g₂
```

- **Monomorphism** (monic) is dual:

```text
f: A → B is monic if:
  ∀ C ∀ g₁, g₂: C → A,
    if f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂,
    then g₁ = g₂
```

> These definitions generalize injectivity/surjectivity to *any* category.

## Philosophical Framing
- **Modeling** = representing a structure in a broader context
- **Abstraction** = collapsing detail into simplified signals
- Both lead to loss of invertibility — and are central to programming, mathematics, and thought
