# Lecture 2.2: Monomorphisms and the Void/Unit Types

## Monomorphism
- Categorical dual of epimorphism
- f: A → B is **monic** if:

```text
  ∀ C ∀ g₁, g₂: C → A,
    if f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂,
    then g₁ = g₂
```

- Defined purely using composition and identity
- Generalizes injectivity to any category
- **Not** all epi + mono = isomorphism in every category!

---

## Void Type (⊥ / False)
- Empty set (∅) in set theory
- `Void` type in Haskell (ignoring bottoms)
- No constructor → no values

### Interesting Properties
- Function `f: Void → A` is always valid (vacuously)
- You can't **call** it, but it's part of the category (e.g., `id :: Void -> Void`)
- Haskell name: `absurd :: Void -> a`

> In logic: `Void ≅ False`, and `absurd` corresponds to ex falso quodlibet: from falsehood, anything follows.

---

## Unit Type (⊤ / True)
- Singleton set: only one value
- Haskell type: `()` (unit)
- Can always be constructed → always available

### Morphism Insight
- `f: () → A` = choose one `A`
- These are **constant** functions

> The number of morphisms `() → A` equals the number of elements of `A`

---

## Elements as Morphisms
- Morphisms from `()` → `A` act like **generalized elements**
- Let us “probe” an object categorically, even if we can’t see internal elements

---

## Summary
- **Monomorphism** = categorical injective
- **Void/Unit** types provide foundational examples
- **Elements as morphisms** let us navigate a category without internal access
